## idm-multitalent_002 adapter for ioBroker
Read sensor data and read and write settings of a iDM heatpump with multitalent.002 control.

Currently following versions are supported (if your version is not listed but you are interested please contact me):
| SW Name | ID in firmware | status |
| :------ | -------------- | -----: |
| TERRA050701 | idm701 (idm701100) | supported, one installation |
| TERRA061001 | idm712 (idm712100) | supported, one installation |
| EVR-070110 | idm722 (idm722100) | supported, one installation |
| EVR-II071102 | idm750 (idm750100) | experimentally, no known installation, issues with data definitions |
| EVR-II100201 | EVR752 (EVR752101) | support in development currently, one experimental installation |
| TERRA130601 | S_H726 (S_H726100) | supported, one installation |

You need a Ethernet to RS422 converter to connect to the multitalent control.
**Note** that you have to connect ground/shield of your converter to the ground of the control/heatpump in order to prevent electric influences on the sensor readings.
There are sensor values and settings values. During a cycle all sensor values and one part of the settings values are read. So the sensor values are read more frequently than the settings values. 
The changed values are transferred immediately.
Note that settings of the heatpump are only read all ~5-6 cycles, so when setting values the acknowledgment might take some time.

During bootup of the heatpump control (e.g. after a power loss) no values should be polled. This is currently **NOT** ensured by the adapter. So you **manually** need to **stop** it. If the control of the heatpump did not start due to the adapter then simply stop the adapter and power cycle the control. This should fix the problem. Afterwards you can start the adapter again. I implemented a delayed switch-on of the serial server. This also mitigates the problem.

Example installation:

Settings of the serial adapter:
```
 Baud Rate(bps) 19200
 Parity         Even
 Data Bit       8
 Stop Bit       1
 Flow Control   None
 UART FIFO      Disable
```

## Installation
As the adapter is not (yet) listed in the official ioBroker repository you have to download the tgz file from here (github or npmjs).
1. Upload the file to your ioBroker host
1. Install it locally (The paths are different on Windows):
    ```bash
    cd /opt/iobroker
    npm i /path/to/tarball.tgz
    ```

## Developer manual
Missing documentation about the data structures/blocks.

Attention, still experimental, ... the adapter sets values of the heatpump, so do not install, unless you know what you are doing and have contacted the author!
